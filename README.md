# Soil Predation

#### Data and code for soil predation project

We will use manipulated microcosms two test three main hypotheses: 1) Predation exerts a significant
top-down control on bacterial community composition; 2) This predator-induced effect on bacteria
interacts with temperature and soil structure; and 3) Changes to bacterial community structure directly 
alters plant-available nutrients.

Heat-sterilized agricultural soils were inoculated with four microbial community treatments, natural
communities, natural bacteria only, natural bacteria plus ameobal predators, and heat-killed bacteria and
amoebae as a negative control. Each microcosm had 24 replicates at each of three temperatures 
for a total of 288 units. The experiment took place over 60 days, with three units destructively 
sampled for metagenomic DNA and chemical analyses at days 0, 15, 30, and 60. 
At the conclusion of the experiment, all samples were subjected to chemical analyses 
and high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial community composition.
