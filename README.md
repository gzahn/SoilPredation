# Soil Predation

#### Data and code for soil predation project

We used manipulated microcosms two test three main hypotheses: 1) Predation exerts a significant
top-down control on bacterial community composition; 2) This predator-induced effect on bacteria
interacts with temperature and soil structure; and 3) Changes to bacterial community structure directly 
alters plant-available nutrients.

Each microcosm treatment had 6 replicates from each experimental treatment at each sampling period.

Microbial community - 4 levels - 1) bacteria and live amoebae, 2) bacteria and heat-killed amoebae, 3) heat-killed bacteria and live amoebae, 4) heat-killed bacteria and heat-killed amoebae as a sterile control. 
Sampling treatments:

Temperature - 2 levels - (20 deg and 25 deg) 

Time - 6 levels - The experiment took place over 5 weeks, with six units destructively sampled for metagenomic DNA and chemical analyses at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 29, and 36. 

Total N = 288

At the conclusion of the experiment, all samples were subjected to chemical analyses 
and high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial community composition.
